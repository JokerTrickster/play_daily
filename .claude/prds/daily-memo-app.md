# PRD: Daily Memo App

## Executive Summary

The Daily Memo App is an Android mobile application that enables users to record, organize, and share their daily experiences tied to specific locations. Users can document places they visit with photos, ratings, notes, and visit dates, visualize their memories on an interactive map, and collaborate with others by sharing their memo spaces. The app focuses on frontend implementation with Clean Architecture, designed to integrate with a backend API in future phases.

**Value Proposition**: A personal location diary that transforms everyday experiences into an organized, searchable, and shareable visual memory map.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
People want to remember and share meaningful places they've visited, but existing solutions are either:
- Too complex (travel planning apps with unnecessary features)
- Too simple (note-taking apps without location context)
- Not collaborative (can't easily share experiences with friends/family)
- Lack visual organization (no map-based memory visualization)

### Why is this important now?
- Mobile users increasingly value location-based experiences and memories
- Social sharing of experiences is becoming more selective and private (moving away from public social media)
- People want lightweight tools that focus on personal memory preservation rather than social broadcasting
- Map-based interfaces are intuitive and provide spatial context that enhances memory recall

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Persona 1: The Memory Keeper**
- Age: 25-40
- Behavior: Visits new restaurants, cafes, and interesting places regularly
- Goal: Keep a personal diary of places with photos and notes for future reference
- Pain Point: Can't remember details about places visited months ago

**Persona 2: The Collaborative Explorer**
- Age: 20-35
- Behavior: Explores places with friends/partner and wants to maintain shared memories
- Goal: Build a shared collection of places visited together
- Pain Point: No easy way to collaboratively maintain a location-based memory collection

### User Journeys

#### Journey 1: New User Onboarding & First Memory
1. User downloads and opens the app
2. Sees signup screen, enters ID, password, and authentication code
3. System validates authentication code and creates account
4. User automatically logged in, personal memo space auto-created with unique ID
5. Location permission dialog appears, user grants permission
6. User sees empty map with their current location marked
7. User taps "Add Memory" button
8. Searches for a cafe they're currently at using Kakao Maps search
9. Selects the location from search results
10. Adds 2 photos, gives 8/10 rating, writes a short note about the coffee
11. Visit date defaults to today
12. Saves the memory
13. Sees the location appear as a pin on the map

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Signup completes only with valid authentication code
- No attempt limit for authentication code validation
- Personal memo space auto-creates on first login

#### Journey 2: Viewing Memories
1. User opens the app and sees the map view by default
2. Multiple pins visible on map showing saved locations
3. Taps a pin to see preview (photo thumbnail, rating, place name)
4. Switches to List View to see memories sorted by various criteria
5. Changes sort order from "Recent" to "Highest Rated"

#### Journey 3: Collaborative Memo Space
1. User wants to share their memo space with a friend
2. Searches for friend by their user ID
3. Sends collaboration invite (friend receives notification)
4. Friend accepts and joins the memo space
5. Friend can now see all existing memories in that space
6. Friend adds a new memory to the shared space
7. Both users see the new memory immediately
8. Friend can edit/delete any memory in the shared space (including ones they didn't create)
9. Original user later decides to delete their account
10. Shared memo space is deleted, friend loses access

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User search by ID returns exact matches only
- Collaboration invites sent via in-app notification
- Joining a shared space grants access to all historical memories
- All participants have full edit/delete permissions for all memories
- No permission levels (all participants equal)
